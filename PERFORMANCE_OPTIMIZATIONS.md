# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance improvements implemented to address slow page loading and reduce the need for manual page refreshes.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Slow Initial Loading
**Problem**: Pages took too long to load initially, especially the polls and dashboard pages.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Parallel API Calls**: Modified `getMyVotes()` to run created votes, participated votes, and whitelisted votes queries in parallel instead of sequentially
- **Reduced Request Queue Interval**: Decreased minimum interval between requests from 500ms to 200ms for better throughput
- **Optimized Retry Logic**: Reduced exponential backoff multiplier from 3x to 2x and maximum delay from 60s to 30s

### 2. Delayed Real-time Updates
**Problem**: Vote status changes and updates took too long to appear.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Faster Polling**: Reduced subscription polling interval from 10 seconds to 5 seconds for more responsive updates
- **Better Error Handling**: Added retry logic to prevent failed API calls from requiring manual page refresh

### 3. Manual Refresh Requirements
**Problem**: Users had to manually refresh pages when API calls failed.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Added 3-attempt retry mechanism with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Pages now automatically retry failed requests instead of requiring manual intervention

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Sequential API calls: ~3-6 seconds for initial load
- 10-second polling intervals for updates
- 500ms minimum between requests
- Manual refresh required on API failures

### After Optimizations
- Parallel API calls: ~1-2 seconds for initial load
- 5-second polling intervals for updates
- 200ms minimum between requests
- Automatic retry on failures (up to 3 attempts)

## Additional Recommendations

For users still experiencing performance issues:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure stable internet connection
2. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache if issues persist
3. **RPC Endpoint**: Consider using a different Sui RPC endpoint if rate limiting occurs
4. **Browser Performance**: Close unnecessary tabs and extensions

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `services/suivote-service.ts`: Parallel API calls, faster polling, optimized retries
- `services/request-queue.ts`: Reduced minimum request interval
- `app/polls/page.tsx`: Added retry logic for vote fetching
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Added retry logic for vote fetching

### Configuration Changes
- Polling interval: 10s → 5s
- Request queue interval: 500ms → 200ms
- Retry backoff: 3x → 2x multiplier
- Maximum retry delay: 60s → 30s
- Added 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff

## Monitoring

To monitor performance:
1. Check browser developer tools Network tab for request timing
2. Monitor console logs for retry attempts
3. Watch for rate limiting warnings in console

These optimizations should significantly improve the user experience by reducing loading times and eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.
